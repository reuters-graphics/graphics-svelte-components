By default, Datawrapper will export your chart with the title, chatter and notes. At the moment, these
don't match our styles, can't be made to fit into the well and will necessarily stretch to fit the graph width and
can't be modified. You can do all of these things by removing all the text from your Datawrapper chart before
publishing it and instead adding whatever you need inside the component via slots as below.
