The `Section` component is the basic building block of stories.

> ðŸ“Œ Many of our other components already use the `Section` component, internally. You'll usually only need to use it yourself if you're making something custom.

```svelte
<script>
  import { Section } from '@reuters-graphics/graphics-svelte-components';
</script>


<Section width="normal">
  <!-- Your stuff for this section -->
</Section>
```
