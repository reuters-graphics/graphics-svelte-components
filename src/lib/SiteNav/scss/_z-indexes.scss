/*
Several components utilize z-index, the CSS property that helps control layout by providing a third axis to arrange content. We utilize a default z-index scale that’s been designed to properly layer navigation, tooltips and popovers, modals, and more.
These higher values start at an arbitrary number, high and specific enough to ideally avoid conflicts. We need a standard set of these across our layered components—tooltips, popovers, navbars, dropdowns, modals—so we can be reasonably consistent in the behaviors.
To handle overlapping borders within components (e.g., buttons and inputs in input groups), we use low single digit z-index values of 1, 2, and 3 for default, hover, and active states. On hover/focus/active, we bring a particular element to the forefront with a higher z-index value to show their border over the sibling elements.
